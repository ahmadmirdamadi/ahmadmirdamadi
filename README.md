### Hi there 👋

🧑‍💻I have been interested in programming since I was 16 years old, and I started learning programming 
through various online courses, and then I started learning and gaining experience in the field of 
artificial intelligence and data science,and I am currently working on a therapy project with the team.
I am very interested in teamwork, because in teamwork, if the team is united, they can even change the world
